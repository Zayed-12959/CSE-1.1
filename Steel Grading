A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions: 

(i) Hardness must be greater than 60
(ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7 
(iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5000 

The grades are as follows: 
Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met 
Grade is 9 if condition (i) and (ii) are met 
Grade is 8 if condition (ii) and (iii) are met 
Grade is 7 if condition (i) and (iii) are met 
Grade is 6 if only one condition is met 
Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met 

Write a program which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){

    int hardness,tensile;
    float carbon;

    printf("Enter Hardness:");
    scanf("%d", &hardness);
    printf("Enter carbon content:");
    scanf("%f", &carbon);
    printf("Enter tensile strength:");
    scanf("%d", &tensile);

    if(hardness>60 && carbon<0.7 && tensile>5000){
        printf("Grade 10");
    }
    else if(hardness>60 && carbon<0.7){
        printf("Grade 9");
    }
    else if(carbon<0.7 && tensile>5000){
        printf("Grade 8");
    }
    else if(hardness>60 && tensile>5000){
        printf("Grade 7");
    }
    else if(hardness>60 || carbon<0.7 || tensile>5000){
        printf("Grade 6");
    }
    else{
        printf("Grade 5");
    }

return 0;
}
