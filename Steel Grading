A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions: 

(i) Hardness must be greater than 60
(ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7 
(iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5000 

The grades are as follows: 
Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met 
Grade is 9 if condition (i) and (ii) are met 
Grade is 8 if condition (ii) and (iii) are met 
Grade is 7 if condition (i) and (iii) are met 
Grade is 6 if only one condition is met 
Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met 

Write a program which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float hardness, carbon_content;
    int tensile_strength, grade = 5, count = 0;

    printf("Enter Hardness: ");
    scanf("%f", &hardness);
    
    printf("Enter Carbon Content: ");
    scanf("%f", &carbon_content);
    
    printf("Enter Tensile Strength: ");
    scanf("%d", &tensile_strength);

    int cond1 = (hardness > 50);
    int cond2 = (carbon_content < 0.7);
    int cond3 = (tensile_strength > 5000);

    count = cond1 + cond2 + cond3;

    if (count == 3) 
        grade = 10;
    else if (cond1 && cond2) 
        grade = 9;
    else if (cond2 && cond3) 
        grade = 8;
    else if (cond1 && cond3) 
        grade = 7;
    else if (count == 1) 
        grade = 6;

    printf("Grade of Steel: %d\n", grade);

    return 0;
}
